# Link State Protocol

- Each router calculates the shortest path using Dijkstra’s algorithm.
- Exchange information about the status of their connection instead of number of hops
- Converges faster than Distance-Vector Protocol.

Examples:

- OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):
    - Also known as Dijkstra’s Algorithm
